# Telia Arendaja - proovi√ºlesanne

This is a test task for Developer position @ Telia. It is a simple button with a dropdown, which items are dynamically passed into Button component. App is built using React JS.

Main features include:
- rendering items based on provided attributes of each item
- dropdown position is defined by button location on screen. If there's not enough space on Y axis, dropdown is made smaller until it fits (either below or above the button, using the larger option of these two)
- three color schemes
- selected item is passed to State variable so that it can be used later
